        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. This is always done in the beginning of the element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>The 'style' element defines the CSS styles associated with the website.</li>
          <li>The 'base' element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The 'link' elementconnects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The 'meta' element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The 'script' element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The header appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content</li>
          <li> The main HTML element represents the dominant content of the body of a document.</li>
          <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. External being the most preferred.</li>
          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule. </li>
          <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class, .card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git revert: revert to an earlier version of the code, possibly to fix a bug.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch & switches to it.</li>
          <li> <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">git-cheat-sheet</a> </li>
          <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testing their solutions.</li>
          <li>In a feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working. Next we push, then open a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pull down any changes from the main branch, to ensure the local branch is in sync.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li> JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts</li>
          <li>conditional statements such as 'if' statements allows us to interrupt control flow. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets. But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute</li>
          <li>The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>'/*' Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later.</li>
          <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function's name is followed by parentheses.</li>
